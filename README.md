This page contains all the codes used in Arxiv https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00679

For Fig. 3 and 5, see kl_underdamped_gauss
For the overdamped solution of the cell problem, see OVERDAMPED_KL
For corrections to underdamped solutions, (Figs 6-8) see kl_divergence


The Entropy production codes for the companion paper [Minimal- work protocols for inertial particles in non-harmonic traps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15678), including codes for Fig. 4, can be found in the [entropy production repository](https://github.com/julia-sand/entropyproduction)
