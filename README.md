This page contains all the codes used in [2403.00679](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00679) and [2411.08518](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08518)

In [2403.00679](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.00679)
For Fig. 3 and 5, see kl_underdamped_gauss (using Julia v1.7.3 and DifferentialEquations.jl v7.7.0)
For the overdamped solution of the cell problem, see OVERDAMPED_KL
For corrections to underdamped solutions, (Figs 6-8) see kl_divergence

The codes for Entropy production case used in the preprint [Minimal- work protocols for inertial particles in non-harmonic traps](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15678) can be found in the [entropy production repository](https://github.com/julia-sand/entropyproduction). This also includes the code for Fig. 4 from 2403.00679. 

In [2411.08518](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.08518)
For Figs 2 and 4, see the notebook mc_integration_kl
For Fig 5, see the notebook nn_overdamped
